# get_next_line
A `C` function that reads any valid file line by line until the end.

This is my version of the [42](https://www.42.us.org/) cadet project `get_next_line`.

It uses linked lists, and I created a data structure `t_gnl` for it.

It uses several fuctions for the previous project, `libft`, including `ft_strchr`, `ft_strsub`, `ft_strdup`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_strcpy`, and `ft_strlen`. In the process of making `get_next_line`, I created one more function, `ft_strchrindex`, which I added to libft . `ft_strchrindex` is super simple, but I included it here too.
