# get_next_line
A C function that reads any valid file line by line until the end.

My version of the 42 cadet project get_next_line.

It uses linked lists, and I created a data structure t_gnl for it.

It uses several fuctions for the previous project, libft, including ft_strchr, ft_strsub, ft_strdup, ft_strjoin, ft_bzero, ft_strcpy, and ft_strlen.

In the process of making get_next_line, I created one more function which I added to libft, ft_strchrindex. I included it here.
