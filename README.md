# get_next_line
A `C` function that reads any valid file, line by line, until the end.

This is my version of the **[42](https://www.42.us.org/)** cadet project `get_next_line`.

It uses linked lists, and I created a data structure `t_gnl` for it.

It uses several fuctions for the previous project, `libft`, including `ft_strchr`, `ft_strsub`, `ft_strdup`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_strcpy`, and `ft_strlen`. In the process of making `get_next_line`, I created one more function, `ft_strchrindex`, which I added to `libft`. `ft_strchrindex` is super simple, but I included it here too.

`hitchhikersguidetothegalaxy-p1.txt` is simply a text file of the first 3 paragraphs of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. I oftened used it as my test text file while working on this. It's a bit more fun than making a file of random gibberish.
